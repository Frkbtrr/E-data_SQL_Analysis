# E-Commerce Data and Customer Retention Analysis with SQL
SQL Analytics Project

An e-commerce organization demands some analysis of sales and delivery 
processes. Thus, the organization hopes to be able to predict more easily the 
opportunities and threats for the future.

In this project, I designed a database to hold the companies data in the star schema by building an ERD. I utilised MySql Workbench to create and populate the tables and wrangle the data into right format(datetime,floating etc.). I established relationships between tables.

Analyze the data

Tried to analyse top customers, logistic efficiency of the orders, order ratios and the differences. I queried the database and verified the result manually.  I utilised MySql Workbench to analyse the data as well.

Please enjoy with the results...:D
